## 🚀 Overview

Customer churn is a critical business problem where companies lose customers over time. This project builds a complete ML system to:

* Predict which customers are likely to churn
* Quantify risk using probability scores
* Help businesses take preventive actions
* Explain *why* customers are likely to leave

---

## 🧠 Key Features

### 🔹 Batch Prediction

* Upload customer data (CSV)
* Get churn probability for each customer
* Automatically ranked by risk level

### 🔹 Real-Time Prediction

* Simulate individual customer profiles
* Instantly see churn probability

### 🔹 Risk Segmentation

* 🟢 Low Risk
* 🟡 Medium Risk
* 🔴 High Risk

---

### 🔹 Explainable AI (SHAP)

* Identifies key drivers of churn
* Shows feature impact on predictions

---

### 🔹 Model Evaluation Metrics

* **AUC Score:** ~0.82
* **Precision / Recall / F1:** Computed dynamically in the dashboard (based on uploaded labeled data and selected threshold)
